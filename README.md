Reduced Basis Methods for the wave equation


The b-Spline implementation is taken from C. Mollet's PhD Thesis * Parabolic PDEs in Space-Time Formulations: Stability for Petrov-Galerkin Discretizations with B-Splines and Existence of Moments for Problems with Random Coefficients* which can be found [here](https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/6872/)
